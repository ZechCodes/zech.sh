I'm Zech Zimmerman — a Python developer, open-source creator, and community builder who's been shipping code for over twenty years.

I started writing software as a kid and never stopped. Along the way, I built [Bevy](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Bevy) — a dependency injection framework for Python — and [Skrift](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Skrift), the async CMS that powers this very site. I'm also building [Schism](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Schism) (monolith-to-microservice framework) and [Ommi](https://github.com/ZechCodes/Ommi) (cross-ORM object mapping), both approaching their first stable releases. Everything ships open.

I also built [Smarter.Dev](/discord), a 13,000+ member Discord community where developers learn, ship, and level up together. It started as Beginner.Codes — a place for new developers to get real help from real developers. It grew into something bigger.

## What I'm Building Now

The next chapter is AI. Not the buzzword kind — the kind that actually changes how you work. I'm building tools that anticipate what you need before you ask for it:

- **A budget app** that warns you before you overspend — open source, your data stays yours
- **A workflow tool** that handles daily busywork — agendas, follow-ups, research — before you think to ask
- **A writing tool** that pulls in context as you type, informed by everything you've been working on

Same obsession with elegant systems. New frontier.

## The .sh

The domain is deliberate. Shell scripts execute. They get things done. The shift from `.codes` to `.sh` signals a move from "I write code" to "I build products that ship."

## Get in Touch

The best way to reach me is through the [Smarter.Dev Discord](/discord). I'm there every day.

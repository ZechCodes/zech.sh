## Smarter.Dev

13,000+ developers. No fluff, no gatekeeping — just people who take their craft seriously.

Smarter.Dev started as **Beginner.Codes**, a Discord server for new programmers who wanted real help from real developers. It grew into a full community of builders at every level — juniors shipping their first projects, seniors mentoring and learning from each other, and everyone in between.

## What Happens Here

- **Code reviews** — Post your code, get honest feedback
- **Pair programming** — Work through problems together in real time
- **Project showcases** — Share what you've built, get constructive input
- **Technical discussions** — Deep dives on Python, architecture, AI, and the craft of building software
- **Mentoring** — Learn from experienced developers who remember what it was like to start

## The Culture

We don't do gatekeeping. Ask any question. Ship anything. The only expectation is that you're here to get better at building software.

No spam, no self-promotion wars, no "just Google it" energy. People help because they want to.

## Join

The community lives on Discord. I'm there every day.

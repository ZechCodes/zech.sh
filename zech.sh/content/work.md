Everything I build ships open. Here's what's done, what's close, and what's next.

## Shipped

### Bevy

Dependency injection for Python. Clean, typed, zero boilerplate. Bevy lets you wire up complex applications without the mess. Done and stable.

### Skrift

An async Python CMS built on Litestar with WordPress-style conventions — themes, hooks, multi-site support. It powers zech.sh and dump.zech.sh right now.

## In Progress

### Schism

Write one codebase. Deploy as a monolith or microservices. Schism handles the split at runtime — same code, different topologies. Getting close.

### Ommi

One object model across SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. Works with dataclasses, Attrs, and Pydantic. Map once, query anywhere. Almost there.

## Smarter.Dev

A 13,000+ member Discord community for developers who take their craft seriously. Code reviews, mentoring, pair programming, and real conversations about building software.

Started as Beginner.Codes. Grew into something bigger.

## AI Products

The current chapter. Three tools, one ecosystem — all built around the same idea: the best software acts before you ask it to.

**AI Budget App** — Your budget, one step ahead. Proactive alerts, intelligent planning, goal-oriented decisions. Open source — you own your data.

**Automated Work SaaS** — Your AI-powered chief of staff. Daily agendas built automatically. Research, follow-ups, and scheduling handled before you think to ask.

**AI Writing App** — Documents informed by everything you've been working on. Start typing. It already knows what comes next.

## dump.zech.sh

Brain dumps, code dumps, thought dumps. Technical deep dives on async/await, metaclasses, dependency injection, and whatever I'm building at the time.
